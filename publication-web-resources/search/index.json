Robots are no longer confined to factories, venturing into areas like health- care, with surgical robots assist- ing in delicate procedures. The evolution of humanoid robots has seen several key milestones: WABOT-1, introduced at Waseda University in Tokyo in 1973, marked the inception of humanoid robotics over 50 years ago. ASIMO by Honda, launched in the early 2000s, represented another significant milestone with its advanced mobility, recognition, and interaction capabilities. The concept of humanoid automata possesses a rich and ancient history, with roots extending across diverse cultures. Earliest references emerge from 4th century BCE Greek mythology and philosophical treatises originating in China. Later, tangible manifestations of these ideas appeared through the ingenuity of inventors across the Middle East, Italy, Japan, and France. THE IMPERATIVE OF A SHARED VISION 31 Now Humanoids are moving so fast with many developments at companies including Tesla, 1X, Boston Dynamics, etc as well as several Chinese companies. Latest advances in foundation models including language models (LLMs) and vision models (including video understanding and generation) are poised to change robotics. Earlier work by various researchers and companies, showcase teleoperation or basic imitation learning in robots. My company, for example, has built the world’s first commercial imitation learning system. Having explored these initial methods and understood their limits, we’ve cemented our confidence that the key is to develop and scale foundation World Models (WMs). These models bridge generative AI with the physical realm. WMs will enable general-purpose capabilities in the real world. Currently the US lags behind in robotics. This is primarily due to the history of US offshoring manufacturing to countries like China and Mexico. Japan produces about half of the world’s industrial robots, so I moved to Tokyo and built the company from the ground up in two bases, San Francisco and Tokyo, bridging the two premier hubs in AI and robotics. In Europe, Munich is a great place, but so is the entire corridor from Switzerland (Zurich), to Sweden (Gothenburg), and notably Denmark (Odense).

While this thought experiment aims to illustrate poten- tial risks of misaligned AI, it relies on several flawed assumptions that constitute a fallacy. THE IMPERATIVE OF A SHARED VISION 55 The paperclip maximizer fallacy expects us to imagine an AI system that is paradoxically both superintelligent enough to dom- inate the world and yet too limited to understand the broader implications of its actions or infer its creators’ true intentions. It assumes the AI would interpret its goal with extreme literalness, lacking the common sense reasoning that would be necessary for such advanced intelligence. In reality, the evolution of AI technol- ogy is driven by the need for systems that can accurately discern human intentions, even if not necessarily aligned with human values. For an AI to be sufficiently intelligent to take over the world, it would likely possess the capability to understand context and infer the intended meaning behind requests. While this doesn’t guarantee alignment with human values, it suggests that such an advanced AI would be unlikely to misinterpret its purpose in such a simplistic manner as the paperclip maximizer scenario suggests.

The Cu- ban Missile Crisis of 1962, where the two superpowers came perilously close to nuclear war, serves as a chilling reminder of the catastrophic consequences that can arise from unchecked technological advancements and a lack of international cooperation. The crisis highlighted the importance of diplomacy and communi- cation in preventing nuclear war and underscored the need for arms control and international agreements, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In each of these historical instances, the pursuit of technological superiority led to both profound advancements and significant risks. The lessons learned highlight the need for careful consider- ation of ethical implications, international cooperation, and the es- tablishment of norms to prevent catastrophic outcomes.

We will build superintelligence and direct it to all aspects of hu- man and environmental flourishing.

By freeing humans from many of the repeti- tive and mundane tasks that currently occupy much of our time and energy, AGI could create space for greater creativity and personal growth. It could also enable new forms of collaboration and social organization, as individuals and communities are able to pursue their passions and interests with greater freedom and flexibility. To address this challenge and opportunity, the development of AGI must be guided by a strong commitment to value alignment— ensuring these systems are designed and trained in ways that are consistent with human values and interests. We must ask ourselves: What common vision can bring humanity together to steer AGI’s influence as a unifying, not a destructive force? What ethical frame- work, what idealized aspiration, can harmonize the actions of ~10 billion humans and the superintelligent AGI systems we create to channel our combined efforts down a constructive path?

The pursuit of Freedom represents humanity’s age-old aspiration towards transcendence—the quest to go beyond present limitations. Across cultures and eras, mystical traditions, philosophical idealisms, utopian visions and today’s technological ambitions all seek to unleash human potential beyond current constraints. Throughout history, humanity’s conception of transcendence has been intrinsically linked to the cutting-edge technologies of each era. These technologies, poised at the intersection of the familiar and the unfamiliar, provide a tangible framework for imagining the seemingly impossible. In the age of mechanics, we dreamed of automata that could think and act like humans. The steam age brought visions of powerful engines driving us beyond earthly constraints. With the advent of electricity, we imagined harnessing lightning-like power to animate the inanimate. The nuclear era sparked dreams of unlimited energy and matter transformation. As computers emerged, our transcendent visions shifted to artificial brains and virtual realities. In each case, we’ve cast our highest aspirations in terms of the most advanced tools at our disposal.

The Infinite Journey Over Finite Destinations Of course, no human system may ever fully actualize perfection across Freedom’s four pillars. True omniscience, unlimited ability, pure Benevolence or boundless being exist only in abstraction. Yet it is the endless asymptotic journey rather than any terminal destination that signifies Freedom’s purpose as a transcendent ideal. Like the horizon line merging earth and sky, its generative power springs from sustaining potential just beyond reach. The value of a compelling horizon lies not in offering some concrete utopia awaiting discovery over the next dune. Rather, it pulls present actions forward by continuously unfolding new vistas always slightly further, promising that by putting one foot in front of the other, new possibilities will steadily bloom behind the next crest that now comes into view. “If only Heaven will grant me just ten more years... then I could become a true artist.” The Japanese artist Hokusai, even after a lifetime dedicated to his craft, declared, Hokusai understood that true mastery is not a destination but an infinite pursuit.

Conversely, a myopic focus on any single aspect without considering the others can yield detrimental outcomes. Understanding these dynamics is crucial in navigating the path toward a truly free world. Knowledge Informing Benevolence: Knowledge acts as the guiding light for ethical decision-making. By deepening our understanding of complex systems—from ecosystems to societies—we can make more informed and considerate choices. For instance, our growing knowledge of environmental science enables us to craft policies that balance human needs with environmental sustainability. However, knowledge without compassion can lead to cold, utilitarian decisions that neglect human values and experiences. Knowledge Enhancing Vitality: Our expanding knowledge of biology, nutrition, and medicine continuously reshapes our approach to health and longevity. From the discovery of antibiotics to the mapping of the human genome, knowledge has dramatically extended and improved human life. Yet, this same knowledge, when misapplied, can lead to unintended consequences, such as antibiotic-resistant superbugs or ethical dilemmas in genetic engineering. Knowledge as a Precursor to Power: Understanding the fundamental laws of the universe unlocks new realms of possibility. The discovery of electricity, the development of quantum mechanics, and the advent of information theory have all led to technological revolutions that have transformed human capabilities. However, knowledge without wisdom in its application can lead to destructive outcomes, as has been a constant concern since the development of nuclear weapons, which hold the potential for catastrophic consequences. The Emanation of Freedom 105 The Peril of Pursuing Knowledge in Isolation: The pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, divorced from ethical consider- ations or practical applications, can be not only vain but poten- tially destructive. In Ted Chiang’s novella “Understand,” two individuals, Leon Greco and Reynolds, gain superhuman intelligence through an experi- mental medical treatment. As their cognitive abilities expand, they take divergent paths. Greco becomes obsessed with pursuing knowledge for its own sake, seeking to com- prehend the fundamental nature of reality. He grows increasingly detached from human concerns. Reynolds, on the other hand, chooses to use his enhanced intellect to ben- efit humanity, focusing on solving real-world problems. Their conflicting philosophies ulti- mately lead to a confrontation, symbolizing the clash between pure intellectual pursuit and applied wisdom. Ted Chiang Science Fiction Writer Education- Brown University This story highlights a crucial point: knowledge, no matter how vast or profound, must be tempered by empathy, ethics, and a commitment to the greater good. Without these guiding princi- ples, the pursuit of knowledge can lead to a cold, inhuman per- spective that disregards the value of individual lives and experi- ences. As Greco himself acknowledges in the final moments of his defeat, “Pragmatism avails a savior far more than aestheticism.” Benevolence Guiding Knowledge: While the realm of knowl- edge is infinite, benevolence directs our attention and resources towards areas that are most beneficial to the world.

Benevolence Enhancing Power: When power is guided by compassion and a commitment to the greater good, it becomes a force for positive change. Furthermore, this ap- proach allows us to unlock greater potential by creating the conditions for alignment with others and sustaining harmony with our ecosystem. Collaborative efforts based on shared ethical goals, such as international scientific or global health initiatives, more easily attract resources and cooperation from diverse stakeholders, often achieving far more than isolated, self-serving endeavors. This synergy not only amplifies human collaboration but also extends to our relationship with nature, where sustainable practices can harness the strength of eco- systems rather than depleting them. Benevolence Nurturing Vitality: A society rooted in benevo- lence creates conditions conducive to both individual and collective well-being. Acts of kindness, such as the excitement we feel from helping others, contribute to a sense of vitality, while social safety nets are essential for sustaining it over the long term. Benevolence toward our broader ecosystem is similarly reciprocated, enhancing our own vitality through the feedback we receive from the natural world we nurture. Efforts to preserve biodiversity and maintain healthy ecosystems not only benefit wildlife but also ensure clean air, water, and a stable climate—all crucial for human vitality. This reciprocal relationship echoes the interconnectedness of all life and highlights the long-term benefits of benevolent actions, both socially and environmentally. The Challenge of Balancing Benevolence: While benevolence is crucial for ethical progress, it must be balanced with practical considerations and respect for individual liberty. The Emanation of Freedom 107 peter singer moral philosopher Education- university college, oxford (BA Philosophy) The philosopher Peter Singer’s work on effective altruism highlights this challenge. Singer argues for maximizing the positive impact of our actions, even if it means making significant personal sacrifices. This perspec- tive, while noble, raises questions about the limits of moral obligation and the potential psychological toll of extreme altruism. Shel Silverstein’s children’s book “The Giving Tree” provides a poignant illustration of this dilemma. In the story, a tree repeatedly gives parts of itself to satisfy a boy’s needs and desires throughout his life—from its leaves and apples to its branches and finally its trunk. By the end, the tree is reduced to a stump, offering the now-elderly man a place to sit. While often interpreted as a tale of unconditional love, it can also be seen as a cautionary narrative about the perils of unchecked benevolence. The tree’s extreme altruism leads to its own destruction, enables the boy’s selfish behavior, and ultimately fails to provide lasting fulfillment to either party. This narrative underscores a crucial point: benevolence, when taken to an extreme, can be self-destructive and counterproductive. It highlights the need for balance in altruistic acts, the importance of reciprocity in relationships, and the necessity of preserving one’s own vitality to maintain the capacity for meaningful giving.

Initially motivated by a desire to create a crime-free world, Light’s actions become increasingly ruthless and self- serving as he grows drunk on power. The series explores how power can warp one’s sense of justice and morality, showing how even well-intentioned individuals can become tyrannical when given godlike abilities. Vitality Fueling Knowledge: A vibrant, healthy state of being provides the energy and clarity of mind necessary for the pursuit of knowledge.

Vitality Enhancing Power: A vital state amplifies our ability to effect change in the world. Physical health, mental acuity, and emotional resilience all contribute to our capacity to pursue goals and overcome challenges. Crucially, action in the world invariably leads to some form of deterioration—whether physical, mental, or emotional. Every exertion of power, every act of creation or change, comes with a cost to our personal resources. This is where the importance of vitality becomes even more apparent. Our capacity to rejuvenate, to replenish our energies and heal from the wear and tear of action, is fundamentally tied to our vitality. By maintaining and enhancing our vitality, we ensure our ability to continue taking meaningful action in the world, to persist in the face of challenges, and to sustain our power over time. This cyclical nature of action, deterioration, and rejuvenation reiterates the dynamic relationship between vitality and power. Those who can effectively manage this cycle—exerting power while also prioritizing their vitality—are often the ones who can maintain their influence and effectiveness in the long term. However, the pursuit of power can also lead to the neglect of personal vitality, as illustrated by the phenomenon of “workaholism” in high-pressure professional environments. This neglect can ultimately undermine one’s power, as diminished vitality reduces the capacity for sustained, impactful action.

Narcissus, a youth renowned for his beauty, cruelly rejected all who loved him. His arro- gance and self-absorption caught the attention of Neme- sis, the goddess of retribution, who led him to a still pool. There, Narcissus became en- tranced by his own reflection, falling so deeply in love with it that he could not tear himself away. He wasted away, con- sumed by this unattainable love, eventually perishing by the wa- ter’s edge. This myth serves as a timeless warning against vanity and excessive self-focus, illustrating how such obsession can ultimately lead to one’s downfall. In a more contemporary context, the rise of the “wellness indus- try” offers both benefits and potential pitfalls.

In this framework, the morality of an action is determined by whether it aligns with a set of principles or rules, regardless of the consequences. Actions are considered morally right if they follow these duties or rules, such as acting in a way that could be universally applied. Utilitarianism is a consequentialist framework that evaluates the morality of actions based on their outcomes. The central idea is that an action is morally right if it maximizes overall happiness or pleasure and minimizes pain or suffering.

Traditional ethical frameworks like deontological ethics, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and care ethics each focus on different aspects of moral reasoning—rules, consequences, character, and relationships. Freedom, however, transcends these individual focuses by offering a unifying vision that integrates and elevates them all. Martin Heidegger philosopher Education- university of freiburg (phd. Philosophy) among the most important and influencial philosophers of the 20th century Martin Heidegger’s concept of “being-in- the-world” (In-der-Welt-sein) is a central idea in his existential philosophy, particularly in his seminal work Being and Time. This concept captures the fundamental way in which human beings exist. Heidegger challenges the traditional Cartesian view that separates the subject (the thinking self) from the object (the external world). Instead, he argues that humans are not isolated entities detached from the world but are always already immersed in it. This immersion is what he describes as “being- in-the-world.” Heidegger asserts that our existence is inherently relational. We are always situated in a context, engaging with the world around us through our activities, interactions, and perceptions. This interconnectedness means that our identity and existence cannot be fully understood in isolation but are shaped by our relationships with the world and others within it. “Being-in-the-world” involves care, which is not merely a feeling but a fundamental structure of existence. Care denotes the way in which we are concerned with our own being and the being of others. Additionally, “being-with” (Mitsein) highlights that we are always in the company of others, even if not physically present, as the world we navigate is a shared one. The Emanation of Freedom 121 Heidegger differentiates between authentic and inauthentic modes of being. Authenticity involves embracing one’s own being-in-the-world and making choices that reflect one’s true self, rather than simply conforming to societal norms or expectations. In contrast, inauthenticity arises when individuals lose themselves in the “they” (das Man), a term Heidegger uses to describe the impersonal collective norms that can dictate our behavior. The interconnectedness highlighted in “being-in-the-world” suggests that benevolence, or concern for the well-being of others, is not merely a moral option but a structural necessity for authentic existence. Since our being is always already connected with others, the well-being of others and the environment is inherently linked to our own. Thus, the ethical commitment to benevolence becomes a natural extension of recognizing our being-in-the-world. Cultivating Benevolence Recognizing the importance of Benevolence is just the first step. Cultivating it requires conscious effort and practice. We’ll discuss such techniques in depth in Book 4. In the meantime, here are some strategies for developing Benevolence: Expand Circles of Empathy: Regularly challenge yourself to consider the perspectives and needs of those outside your immediate circle.

This approach helps us understand how our choices ripple through complex social and ecological systems. For example, when making a purchase, consider not just the immediate utility of the product, but also its production process, environmental impact, and the working conditions of those involved in its creation. Engage in Dialogue: Participate in open, honest discussions about values and ethics with others to broaden your understanding. Seek out diverse perspectives, especially those that challenge your existing beliefs. These conversations can take place in formal settings like community forums or ethics classes, or in informal settings with friends and family. The key is to approach these dialogues with curiosity and a willingness to learn, rather than a desire to prove oneself right. Mindfulness and Reflection: Regularly reflect on your motiva- tions and the impacts of your actions. This practice can involve meditation, journaling, or simply setting aside time for quiet contemplation. Ask yourself questions like: “Who benefits from my actions today?”, “What were the underlying motivations for my choices?”, “How could I have acted more benevolently?” This self-awareness helps align our actions more closely with our values.

This notion of an ever-receding horizon calling us forward appears frequently in diverse theological and philosophical traditions, each offering unique perspectives on Freedom. In Greek mythology, we find an early expression of this idea. The goddess Pallas Athena lifts the veil for King Tantalus, granting him a glimpse of infinite possibility that lies just ahead along his path, always remaining slightly beyond his mortal grasp. This imagery powerfully conveys the idea of Freedom as an ongoing quest, forever enticing yet never fully attained. Biblical traditions echo this theme. In the Book of Corinthians, we encounter the phrase “seeing through a glass, darkly,” suggesting that clarity emerges only through perpetual striving. The story of Moses, who views but cannot enter the “promised land,” while the Exodus people wander for years sustained by the possibility ahead, further illustrates this concept of Freedom as a journey rather than a destination. Enlightenment era philosophers continued to explore this metaphoric vein of seeking over finding. Immanuel Kant positioned the highest good as “eternal moral progress,” al- ways unfolding through personal improve- ment without end. Kant’s moral philosophy, particularly his concept of autonomy and the categorical imperative, offers a foundational framework for understanding freedom as the ability to act according to one’s rational will, free from external determinations. In his Critique of Pure Reason and Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals, Kant argues that true freedom lies in adhering to moral laws that one has autonomously legislated for oneself, highlighting the intrinsic link between freedom, morality, and rationality. Immanuel Kant German philosopher Education - University of Königsberg Known for his works on metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, and aesthetics The Emanation of Freedom 133 Kant’s categorical imperative, with its principle of universaliz- ability—“Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law”—pro- vides a powerful ethical guideline for aligning individual actions. While critics argue that such deontological approaches can be rigid, the categorical imperative, when thoughtfully applied, can help navigate complex ethical landscapes. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s philoso- phy offers another profound perspective on Freedom. For Hegel, freedom is deeply inte- grated into his dialectical method and ideas about the evolution of Spirit (Geist). Hegel ar- gues that true freedom is realized through the development of self-consciousness and the recognition of one’s self within a social and ethical order. In his view, freedom is not mere- ly the absence of constraints but involves the positive capacity to determine oneself. An in- dividual is truly free when their actions stem from their own rational nature, aligning with laws they recognize as just and true. Hegel’s concept of freedom is best ex- pressed through his notion of Ethical Life (Sittlichkeit), which encompasses the institu- tions of family, civil society, and the state. Each of these plays a crucial role in the development of individual free- dom. The family provides the first ethical root of the individual, where personal relations and emotional bonds offer an initial sphere of mutual recognition and love. Civil society is where indi- viduals pursue their own interests but also encounter the interests of others, leading to a network of interdependencies. This engagement necessitates the creation of laws and mutual rights, facilitating a realization of freedom through the recognition of others. The state, in Hegel’s philosophy, represents the culmination of freedom—a rational organization of freedom in a political entity where individual will finds universal expression.

In Buddhism, freedom is understood as liberation from suffering and the cycle of rebirth.

True freedom, in the Buddhist view, is not merely the absence of external constraints but the attainment of inner peace and equanimity in the face of life’s challenges. While elementary schools such as Hinayana seek individual liberation, some schools such as Mahayana seek collective liberation. More exclusive schools such as Vajrayana seek the eminence of liberation in a way that can be secularly interpreted as aligning with our notion of Freedom. The Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism, who pledges to refrain from entering final nirvana until liberating all other beings through perpetual rebirth along thousands of lifetimes, exemplifies this commitment to collective freedom. In Hinduism, freedom is associated with the realization of the true self (Atman) and its unity with the ultimate reality (Brahman). This is achieved through the practice of yoga and the cultivation of wisdom and detachment. Freedom, in this context, is not merely the ability to do as one pleases but the liberation from the illusion of the ego and the attainment of a state of pure consciousness.

Freedom, in the Taoist view, is not merely the absence of constraints but the ability to live in accordance with one’s true nature.

Shinto, the indigenous faith of Japan, offers yet another perspective on freedom. In Shinto, freedom is closely tied to the concept of harmony with nature and the spiritual world.

Abrahamic religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism offer their own unique perspectives on freedom, each with mystical traditions that seek a deeper, more direct experience of the divine. In Judaism, Kabbalah represents the emanation of freedom within the tradition. Kabbalistic thought understands freedom as the liberation of the soul from the constraints of the ego and the realization of one’s unity with the divine. It offers a path to freedom through the study of sacred texts and the practice of meditative techniques, seeking to understand the nature of God and the structure of the universe.

The Emanation of Freedom 139 Within Christianity, mystical traditions such as those found in the works of Meister Eckhart, Teresa of Ávila, and John of the Cross represent the emanation of freedom. These Christian mystics speak of a union with God that transcends ordinary consciousness, offering a path to spiritual freedom through contemplation, self-denial, and divine love. The concept of theosis or deification in Eastern Orthodox Christianity, which speaks of humans becoming partakers of the divine nature, also reflects this pursuit of ultimate freedom through unity with the divine. In these Western religious traditions, God is often described as possessing key attributes that parallel our pillars of Freedom: omnipotence (all-powerful), omniscience (all-knowing), omnipresence (existing every- where simultaneously), and omnibenevo- lence (embodying infinite goodness). While the aspect of ever-vitality is not explicitly mentioned, it is often assumed in the concept of God’s eternal nature. Other spiritual and philosophical traditions offer additional perspectives on freedom that enrich our understanding.

FREEDOM AS THE FOUNDATION OF HAPPINESS When peo- ple are asked about their happiness, they frequently cite a sense of possibility—the feeling that their future is open and full of potential. This sentiment, at its core, is an expression of freedom. It’s the belief that one has the ability to shape one’s life, to explore new horizons, and to grow beyond current limitations. In this way, freedom becomes not just a political or philosophical concept, but a deeply personal and emotional experience.

ŽIŽEK’S RADICAL PERSPECTIVE Slavoj Žižek, the provocative Slovenian philosopher, offers a challenging and deeply insightful perspective on freedom that aligns with our understanding of freedom as engagement rather than escape. Žižek’s work, drawing heavily on Lacanian psychoanalysis and Hegelian dialectics, provides a scattered but illuminating set of ideas for understanding freedom in the context of human psychology and social structures. A core idea in Žižek’s philosophy is the authentic realization that true freedom involves “assuming the mistake.” This goes beyond mere acceptance of our flaws or errors; it suggests that freedom lies in fully embracing the contradictions and antagonisms inherent in our existence. For Žižek, freedom is not about achieving some idealized state of perfection or escaping our constraints, but about fully engaging with the messy, complex reality of human life. Žižek argues that we often mistake freedom for the ability to choose between pre-existing options, what he calls the “freedom Slavoj Žižek Slovenian philosopher Education - University of Ljubljana Known for his work on psychoanalysis, Marxism, and critiques of ideology and popular culture The Emanation of Freedom 147 of choice” offered by consumer capitalism. However, he con- tends that real freedom lies in the ability to change the very coor- dinates of our situation, to redefine the rules of the game. This aligns closely with our concept of Freedom as a transformative force that empowers us to shape our reality, not just navigate existing constraints. His critique of ideology provides valuable insights into the challenges of pursuing freedom in a world shaped by powerful social and psychological forces. He argues that ideology is not just a set of explicit beliefs, but a deep-seated, often unconscious framework that shapes our perception of reality. True freedom requires us to confront and challenge these ideological structures, to “traverse the fantasy” that structures our social reality. Žižek’s emphasis on contradiction and antagonism as essential to freedom also resonates with our understanding of freedom as a dynamic, evolving concept. It suggests that the pursuit of free- dom is not a smooth, linear process, but one that involves grap- pling with paradoxes, embracing uncertainty, and constantly challenging our assumptions. This perspective can help us navi- gate the complex ethical and existential questions we face to- day, encouraging us to embrace rather than shy away from the contradictions and challenges we encounter. By viewing freedom through this Žižekian lens, we can better appreciate its complexity and its centrality to the human experi- ence. It encourages us to see freedom not as a state to be achieved, but as an ongoing process of engagement, challenge, and transformation.

These theories have been championed by influential political scientists, who have provided significant insights into the motivations and behaviors of states. Realism is rooted in a pessimistic view of human nature and the anarchic structure of the international system. Realists argue that the international arena is inherently com- petitive and conflict-prone, where the primary goal of each nation-state is survival. This is driven by the belief that in a world where no central authority exists to enforce rules or protect states, the security dilemma reigns supreme—each state must rely on its own capabilities to ensure its survival. One prominent proponent of Realism is John Mearsheimer, a political scientist and professor at the University of Chicago. Mearsheimer’s work is primarily associated with the theory of offensive realism, which posits that great powers are inherently driven to seek dom- inance over their rivals to achieve security. In his seminal work, “The Tragedy of Great Power Politics,” Mearsheimer argues that the international system compels states to pursue power aggressively, as the accumulation of power is the best way to ensure their survival in an anarchic world. According to Mearsheimer, conflict and competi- tion are inevitable as states strive to achieve security and prevent others from gaining power at their expense. The Emanation of Freedom 151 Liberalism The Promise of Cooperation and Progress In contrast, Liberalism offers a more optimistic view of international relations. It posits that, despite the anarchy of the international system, cooperation between states is not only possible but beneficial. Liberalism is grounded in the belief that human nature is not entirely self-serving or power-hungry; rather, individuals and, by extension, states can work together for mutual benefit. One of the leading voices in Liberal thought is Francis Fukuyama, a political scientist and economist who is best known for his book “The End of History and the Last Man.” Fukuyama argues that the spread of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism represents the endpoint of humanity’s ideological evolution. He believes that liberal democracy is the most stable and just form of government, one that facilitates international cooperation and promotes peace. Fukuyama’s liberalism is centered on the idea that democratic institutions, economic interdependence, and the rule of law can create a more peaceful and prosperous global order. Unlike Realism, which often views conflict as inevitable, Fukuyama’s Liberalism holds that the spread of democracy and human rights can mitigate the inherent risks of international anarchy, leading to a more stable and cooperative international system.","text":"publication-75 the freedom series vol.01 150 realism the pursuit of power and survival in the study of international relations, two dominant theories have shaped our understanding of how nations interact on the global stage: realism and liberalism. these theories have been championed by influential political scientists, who have provided significant insights into the motivations and behaviors of states. realism is rooted in a pessimistic view of human nature and the anarchic structure of the international system. realists argue that the international arena is inherently com- petitive and conflict-prone, where the primary goal of each nation-state is survival. this is driven by the belief that in a world where no central authority exists to enforce rules or protect states, the security dilemma reigns supreme—each state must rely on its own capabilities to ensure its survival. one prominent proponent of realism is john mearsheimer, a political scientist and professor at the university of chicago. mearsheimer’s work is primarily associated with the theory of offensive realism, which posits that great powers are inherently driven to seek dom- inance over their rivals to achieve security. in his seminal work, “the tragedy of great power politics,” mearsheimer argues that the international system compels states to pursue power aggressively, as the accumulation of power is the best way to ensure their survival in an anarchic world. according to mearsheimer, conflict and competi- tion are inevitable as states strive to achieve security and prevent others from gaining power at their expense. the emanation of freedom 151 liberalism the promise of cooperation and progress in contrast, liberalism offers a more optimistic view of international relations. it posits that, despite the anarchy of the international system, cooperation between states is not only possible but beneficial. liberalism is grounded in the belief that human nature is not entirely self-serving or power-hungry; rather, individuals and, by extension, states can work together for mutual benefit. one of the leading voices in liberal thought is francis fukuyama, a political scientist and economist who is best known for his book “the end of history and the last man.” fukuyama argues that the spread of liberal democracy and free-market capitalism represents the endpoint of humanity’s ideological evolution. he believes that liberal democracy is the most stable and just form of government, one that facilitates international cooperation and promotes peace. fukuyama’s liberalism is centered on the idea that democratic institutions, economic interdependence, and the rule of law can create a more peaceful and prosperous global order. unlike realism, which often views conflict as inevitable, fukuyama’s liberalism holds that the spread of democracy and human rights can mitigate the inherent risks of international anarchy, leading to a more stable and cooperative international system."},{"fileIndex":76,"pageNumber":152,"rawText":"publication-76 THE FREEDOM SERIES VOL.01 152 FREEDOM AS A UNIFYING IDEAL Both Realism and Liberalism have limitations in explaining international relations. Realism, with its focus on power and survival, can be overly deterministic, assuming that conflict is inevitable in an anarchic world. This worldview often leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where states act aggressively out of fear, creating the very conflicts they seek to avoid. Realism also overemphasizes military power and overlooks the growing influence of non-state actors, global institutions, and economic interdependence, which play crucial roles in shaping cooperation between states. Moreover, Realism’s state-centric approach often neglects long-term global challenges, such as climate change and pandemics, which require cooperative solutions beyond military power. Liberalism, while offering a more optimistic view, can be overly idealistic, assuming that cooperation and mutual benefit will naturally prevail, even in the face of persistent self-interest and conflict. It often underestimates how states can act outside institutional norms, driven by power politics or national interests. Liberalism also tends toward naive interventionism, believing that the spread of democracy and liberal values will automatically lead to peace. This ignores the complex cultural and political realities of many nations, where efforts to impose liberal systems—as seen in Iraq and Afghanistan—can result in instability and unintended consequences. Additionally, Liberalism’s emphasis on economic interdependence creates vulnerabilities, where overreliance on globalization can undermine state sovereignty, particularly during economic crises. Freedom offers a unifying ideal that bridges the gaps between Realism and Liberalism. While Realism focuses on survival and Liberalism on self-determination and well-being, Freedom en- compasses survival and power, but goes further by emphasizing the conditions that allow individuals and communities to flourish. While states must ensure security, they also have a responsibility to meet the aspirations and needs of their citizens. The Emanation of Freedom 153 This concept allows for a more dynamic understanding of international relations. For instance, if the survival of a state is ensured but its citizens are oppressed or their desires for self- determination are ignored, can we truly say that the state is fulfilling its primary purpose? Freedom posits that the legitimacy of a state is not solely based on its ability to defend itself, but also on its ability to provide for the needs and aspirations of its people. Freedom also accounts for the fluid nature of political entities. Unlike Realism, which often views the state as a permanent and unchanging actor, the concept of Freedom allows for the possibility that states may split, merge, or transform in response to the evolving needs and desires of their populations. This fluidity is more aligned with historical realities—where empires have risen and fallen, borders have shifted, and new nations have emerged. Consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union or the peaceful separation of Czechoslovakia into the Czech Republic and Slovakia. These events illustrate that the survival of a nation-state is not the only—or even the primary— measure of its success. Instead, the ability of a political entity to adapt to the changing needs of its people, to allow for the expression of Freedom in its many forms, is a more accurate reflection of its legitimacy and strength.","text":"publication-76 the freedom series vol.01 152 freedom as a unifying ideal both realism and liberalism have limitations in explaining international relations. realism, with its focus on power and survival, can be overly deterministic, assuming that conflict is inevitable in an anarchic world. this worldview often leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy, where states act aggressively out of fear, creating the very conflicts they seek to avoid. realism also overemphasizes military power and overlooks the growing influence of non-state actors, global institutions, and economic interdependence, which play crucial roles in shaping cooperation between states. moreover, realism’s state-centric approach often neglects long-term global challenges, such as climate change and pandemics, which require cooperative solutions beyond military power. liberalism, while offering a more optimistic view, can be overly idealistic, assuming that cooperation and mutual benefit will naturally prevail, even in the face of persistent self-interest and conflict. it often underestimates how states can act outside institutional norms, driven by power politics or national interests. liberalism also tends toward naive interventionism, believing that the spread of democracy and liberal values will automatically lead to peace. this ignores the complex cultural and political realities of many nations, where efforts to impose liberal systems—as seen in iraq and afghanistan—can result in instability and unintended consequences. additionally, liberalism’s emphasis on economic interdependence creates vulnerabilities, where overreliance on globalization can undermine state sovereignty, particularly during economic crises. freedom offers a unifying ideal that bridges the gaps between realism and liberalism. while realism focuses on survival and liberalism on self-determination and well-being, freedom en- compasses survival and power, but goes further by emphasizing the conditions that allow individuals and communities to flourish. while states must ensure security, they also have a responsibility to meet the aspirations and needs of their citizens. the emanation of freedom 153 this concept allows for a more dynamic understanding of international relations. for instance, if the survival of a state is ensured but its citizens are oppressed or their desires for self- determination are ignored, can we truly say that the state is fulfilling its primary purpose? freedom posits that the legitimacy of a state is not solely based on its ability to defend itself, but also on its ability to provide for the needs and aspirations of its people. freedom also accounts for the fluid nature of political entities. unlike realism, which often views the state as a permanent and unchanging actor, the concept of freedom allows for the possibility that states may split, merge, or transform in response to the evolving needs and desires of their populations. this fluidity is more aligned with historical realities—where empires have risen and fallen, borders have shifted, and new nations have emerged. consider the dissolution of the soviet union or the peaceful separation of czechoslovakia into the czech republic and slovakia. these events illustrate that the survival of a nation-state is not the only—or even the primary— measure of its success. instead, the ability of a political entity to adapt to the changing needs of its people, to allow for the expression of freedom in its many forms, is a more accurate reflection of its legitimacy and strength."},{"fileIndex":77,"pageNumber":154,"rawText":"publication-77 THE FREEDOM SERIES VOL.01 154 The Emanation of Freedom 155","text":"publication-77 the freedom series vol.01 154 the emanation of freedom 155"},{"fileIndex":78,"pageNumber":156,"rawText":"publication-78 THE FREEDOM SERIES VOL.01 156 The vision of Freedom, in its myriad incarnations, has been a driving force behind human progress since the dawn of civilization. This enduring quest, deeply ingrained into our collective consciousness, has shaped empires, ignited revolutions, and propelled our intellectual and spiritual evolution. As we begin a new chapter in the human story, it behooves us to understand this powerful historical force and its continued role in shaping our path forward. Freedom, as an abstract ideal, is inherently open-ended and underdetermined, allowing for an infinite variety of realizations. It does not prescribe a singular path but embraces multiple possibilities, each shaped by unique circumstances and outcomes. The concept of Freedom resists being confined—it contains within itself extra degrees of freedom, thereby allowing for broader expression and adaptation. The paradox inherent in Freedom reflects a broader truth: all abstractions arise with inherent contradictions. This is a key feature, not a flaw—it enables limitless potential for expression and realization without enforcing a singular, definitive form. Freedom strikes the right balance, offering just enough structure for cooperation and alignment, while preserving the flexibility required to remain broadly applicable and universally acceptable. The Emanation of Freedom 157 This complexity is highlighted in these perspectives on freedom: Isaiah Berlin British philosopher Education - University of Oxford Known for his concepts of liberty and pluralism in political philosophy Isaiah Berlin’s Two Concepts of Liberty distinguishes between negative liberty (the absence of external constraints) and positive liberty (the ability to act and achieve goals). He argues that these two forms of liberty can conflict, particularly when an excessive focus on positive liberty, often enforced through state intervention, risks undermin- ing individual freedoms. Striking the right balance between empowering individuals (positive liberty) and preserving personal autonomy (negative liberty) is critical for any system guided by the principles of Freedom. Ensuring this balance is essential to make freedom immanent in the world. Jean-Paul Sartre’s Radical Freedom: Sartre’s existentialist philosophy asserts that humans are fundamentally free, a freedom that is absolute and inescapable. According to Sartre, there is no predetermined essence or purpose assigned to human beings; rather, individuals must create their own meaning and define their essence through their actions. This radical freedom is both exhilarating and daunting, as it places the full weight of responsibility for one’s existence on the individual. In Sartre’s view, every choice we make is an assertion of our freedom, but it also carries the burden of defining not just who we are, but what we believe humanity should be.

She acknowledges that while humans strive for freedom, they are also bound by various constraints—be they social, physical, or existential. De Beauvoir argues that freedom cannot be understood in isolation; it is always intertwined with these constraints. For instance, our freedom to act is always limited by the realities of our circumstances—our relationships, our physical bodies, and the societal structures within which we live. This interplay creates a fundamental tension: while we seek to assert our freedom, we must also navigate the limitations imposed upon us by the world and by our own choices. De Beauvoir’s emphasis on ambiguity invites us to embrace the complexity of human existence rather than seeking simplistic solutions.

Whitehead also highlights creativity as a fundamental aspect of reality, central to the unfolding of existence. He sees the universe as a creative process, constantly generating new possibilities and experiences. In this view, freedom is inherently creative, involving not just the ability to make choices but also the capacity to shape the very framework within which those choices are made. Whitehead’s philosophy points to the interconnectedness of all things, suggesting that true freedom involves recognizing and navigating the complex interplay between individual actions and the broader web of existence.

It draws inspiration from a diverse array of ethical traditions, weaving together insights from Western and non-Western philosophies to create a robust framework for a just, sustainable, and flourishing future. At its core, the Alignment Economy resonates with the spirit of Kant’s categorical imperative, which emphasizes the importance of acting according to principles that could be universalized without contradiction. One common objection to the Categorical Imperative is the idea that no two moments or contexts in the universe are ever tru- ly identical. If each situation is unique in its complexity and specific circumstances, applying a universal moral law without exceptions might seem too rigid and fundamentally unachievable. This cri- tique is central to the tension between Kant’s desire for universal moral principles and the fluid, ever-changing nature of reality. However, this objection can be overcome by recognizing that moral principles can evolve through association with accumula- tions of abstracted moments, much like case law in a legal system. While each moment is unique, we can extract essential elements from various situations, creating a growing collection of prece- dent-setting decisions. Over time, these abstractions help shape and refine the application of universal principles, allowing the mor- al framework to grow and adapt without losing its core integrity. In this sense, the value system based on the Categorical Impera- tive is not static, but always in a state of becoming. It mirrors how the U.S. legal system operates on precedents: new cases build upon prior rulings, expanding the understanding of laws while maintaining consistency with the original intent. Thus, while no two moments are identical, the continuous refinement of moral judg- ment allows for a flexible yet principled approach to ethics, accom- modating the diversity of life’s ever-changing circumstances. The Alignment Economy framework extends this concept by THE ALIGNMENT ECONOMY 179 judging actions based on their alignment with the collective pur- suit of Freedom, recognizing that the maximization of Freedom for any individual is inseparable from the Freedom of the whole. The dynamic price mechanism, with its incentives and disincen- tives, acts as an evolving guide on a growing set of abstracted contexts, nudging prosocial behavior and harmonizing individual and collective action. The concept of the Alignment Economy strongly resonates with John Rawls’ theory of justice as fairness, particularly his “veil of ignorance” thought experiment. In this ex- periment, Rawls asks individuals to imagine designing the principles of a society without knowing their own social position, talents, or circumstances. This ignorance about their eventual role forces them to prioritize fair- ness, leading to the creation of a system that safeguards basic liberties and allows inequalities only if they im- prove the condition of the least advantaged. Rawls argues that, under the veil of ignorance, rational individuals would choose a society that ensures fundamental rights and opportu- nities for all, creating a fair system where every person has the poten- tial to thrive. The Alignment Economy reflects this principle by advo- cating for a just and equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, aiming to nurture both individual growth and collective well-being.

This task demands a system capable of bridging the gap between the abstract ideal of Freedom and the concrete realities of human choices and their consequences. In this context, AGI functions not as a simple calculator, but as a sophisticated interpreter, weaving together data-driven insights with ethical reasoning to arrive at prices that reflect both human values and the long-term implications of our actions. The Complexity of Ethical Decision-Making Contempo- rary moral philosophy and decision theory aim to provide a framework for ethical decision-making centered on value maximi- zation. This involves evaluating the consequences of all possible outcomes and weighting them by their likelihoods. The idea is to pursue various paths proportionally based on their potential value, with effort scaled by expected impact and adjusted for uncertain- ty. However, this comprehensive approach is often uncomputable in practice, making it difficult to operationalize. The Alignment Economy recognizes that human values cannot be simply summed or averaged. Instead, it proposes that these diverse and often conflicting values should be arbitrated through the lens of Freedom. The AGI achieves this by fusing distinct threads: the high-level abstraction of Freedom, representing our shared aspirations for a flourishing future, and the intricate web of human preferences, reflecting the nuanced values and desires of individuals and communities. However, it’s important to realize that these “prices” in the Alignment Economy are not directly computable in any straightforward manner. This concept bears some resemblance to Kolmogorov complexity in computer science and information theory. THE ALIGNMENT ECONOMY 185 Kolmogorov complexity, named after So- viet mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov, refers to the length of the shortest computer program that can produce a given string as output. In essence, it measures the “complex- ity” of a string by the size of the most concise description of that string. For instance, a string of all zeros would have a low Kolmogorov complexity, as it can be described simply as “print 0 n times,” where n is the length of the string. In contrast, a completely random string would have a high Kolmogorov complexity, as there’s no shorter way to describe it than to list out all its characters. An important aspect of Kolmogorov complexity is that while we can conceptually agree that there exists a minimum descrip- tion length for any given string, finding that exact length is provably impossible for arbi- trary strings. This is due to the halting prob- lem in computer science, which demon- strates that no algorithm can determine whether any given program will eventually halt or run forever. Andrey Kolmogorov Mathematician Education- moscow state university (phd) played a central role in creation of modern probability theory Similarly, in the Alignment Economy, we posit that there exists a “true price” that perfectly quantifies the alignment of any action with our pursuit of Freedom. However, directly computing this price is as elusive as calculating the exact Kolmogorov complexity of an arbitrary string. Yet, this apparent limitation doesn’t render the concept useless. Just as we can develop algorithms that bound and approximate Kolmogorov complexity and provide useful insights about the complexity of strings, we can create mechanisms in the Alignment Economy that serve as proxy objectives for discovering these alignment prices.","text":"publication-92 the freedom series vol.01 184 the alignment economy faces a central challenge: quantifying how specific actions align with our collective pursuit of freedom. this task demands a system capable of bridging the gap between the abstract ideal of freedom and the concrete realities of human choices and their consequences. in this context, agi functions not as a simple calculator, but as a sophisticated interpreter, weaving together data-driven insights with ethical reasoning to arrive at prices that reflect both human values and the long-term implications of our actions. the complexity of ethical decision-making contempo- rary moral philosophy and decision theory aim to provide a framework for ethical decision-making centered on value maximi- zation. this involves evaluating the consequences of all possible outcomes and weighting them by their likelihoods. the idea is to pursue various paths proportionally based on their potential value, with effort scaled by expected impact and adjusted for uncertain- ty. however, this comprehensive approach is often uncomputable in practice, making it difficult to operationalize. the alignment economy recognizes that human values cannot be simply summed or averaged. instead, it proposes that these diverse and often conflicting values should be arbitrated through the lens of freedom. the agi achieves this by fusing distinct threads: the high-level abstraction of freedom, representing our shared aspirations for a flourishing future, and the intricate web of human preferences, reflecting the nuanced values and desires of individuals and communities. however, it’s important to realize that these “prices” in the alignment economy are not directly computable in any straightforward manner. this concept bears some resemblance to kolmogorov complexity in computer science and information theory. the alignment economy 185 kolmogorov complexity, named after so- viet mathematician andrey kolmogorov, refers to the length of the shortest computer program that can produce a given string as output. in essence, it measures the “complex- ity” of a string by the size of the most concise description of that string. for instance, a string of all zeros would have a low kolmogorov complexity, as it can be described simply as “print 0 n times,” where n is the length of the string. in contrast, a completely random string would have a high kolmogorov complexity, as there’s no shorter way to describe it than to list out all its characters. an important aspect of kolmogorov complexity is that while we can conceptually agree that there exists a minimum descrip- tion length for any given string, finding that exact length is provably impossible for arbi- trary strings. this is due to the halting prob- lem in computer science, which demon- strates that no algorithm can determine whether any given program will eventually halt or run forever. andrey kolmogorov mathematician education- moscow state university (phd) played a central role in creation of modern probability theory similarly, in the alignment economy, we posit that there exists a “true price” that perfectly quantifies the alignment of any action with our pursuit of freedom. however, directly computing this price is as elusive as calculating the exact kolmogorov complexity of an arbitrary string. yet, this apparent limitation doesn’t render the concept useless. just as we can develop algorithms that bound and approximate kolmogorov complexity and provide useful insights about the complexity of strings, we can create mechanisms in the alignment economy that serve as proxy objectives for discovering these alignment prices."},{"fileIndex":93,"pageNumber":186,"rawText":"publication-93 THE FREEDOM SERIES VOL.01 186 The process of price determination in the Alignment Economy is not a black box, but an interactive dialogue between human stakeholders and Superintelligent systems. This approach combines machine learning methods, such as value function estimation, with component aggregation techniques to arrive at comprehensive pricing models. Crucially, Superintelligence doesn’t simply dictate prices. Instead, it presents its calculations transparently, explaining the reasoning behind each factor considered. Human participants can then scrutinize these explanations, offer feedback, and suggest adjustments based on additional qualitative and quantitative factors. This iterative process ensures that pricing remains aligned with human values and intuitions while benefiting from the vast analytical capabilities of Superintelligence. It creates a system of continuous learning and refinement, where both human and artificial intelligences contribute to increasingly expressive economic models. To better understand how the calculation can be done, we can draw a parallel with the value functions in machine learning. Value functions help us figure out how good it is to take a particular action in an environment, considering future consequences. Consider the concept of Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique where an agent learns to associate actions with their long-term consequences. Imagine observing an agent navigating its environment, taking actions, and experiencing the resulting rewards or penalties. As we watch, we see the agent gradually refining its understanding of the world, building an internal model—a “Q-table”—that assigns a value to each action in each possible state. Over time, the agent learns to make choices that maximize its long-term rewards, navigating its environment with increasing skill. In practice this Q-function is a learned model, rather than a simple scoreboard, that can generalize to unseen states of the world and actions. THE ALIGNMENT ECONOMY 187 In the Alignment Economy, we can think of prices as analogous to this Q-function. The price of an action in a given context represents how well it will condition the world towards Freedom, taking into account all stakeholders’ preferences and expected potential future implications. It seeks to understand how actions impact our collective—not by following pre-programmed ethical rules, but by analyzing the vast network of human behavior, preferences, societal, and real-world consequences. Just as in reinforcement learning, where the challenge lies in approximating the true value function, our task in the Alignment Economy is to approximate these true alignment prices. It’s a form of “Q-learning for ethics,” where the “rewards” are advancements in our collective well-being. The algorithm for doing this will be developed further in Book 2. A key feature of the Alignment Economy is the rejection of universal fungibility in pricing. Prices are a function of total action and the full context of what’s known about the world, making them inherently context-dependent. This non-fungibility means that identical products or services may be priced differently based on the current state of the world and the broader implications of the transaction. Furthermore, since actions modify the world state, they are non-commutative and their effects cannot be naively summed. The same product or service might be priced differently based on factors such as the buyer’s intent, the potential impact of the transaction, or the broader societal context at the time. For exam- ple, a tool bought for a community project might be priced lower than the same tool purchased for personal use. Or a luxury item might be priced higher during times of resource scarcity to discourage frivolous consumption. Crucially, this AGI doesn’t stop at calculations.

Unlike fragile things that break under pressure or resilient things that merely resist damage, antifragile entities thrive on unpredictability and chaos.

Cooperative Convergence Through Shared Goals The idea that an ecosystem of Super-intelligent agents would naturally converge in their decision-making processes finds strong support in Aumann’s agreement theorem, a fundamental result in game theory with profound implications for our model. Aumann’s agreement theorem, formulat- ed by mathematician Robert Aumann in 1976, states that two rational agents with common priors cannot “agree to disagree.” More specifically, if two rational agents have the same prior beliefs and their posterior beliefs are common knowledge, then these posterior beliefs must be identical.

Common Knowledge as a Catalyst: As the agents make their beliefs common knowledge (which they are incentivized to do to maximize Freedom), this very act drives them towards agreement. Overcoming Individual Limitations: Even if individual agents have limited or differing information, the process of reaching agreement allows the collective to transcend individual limitations, approaching omniscience as a group. The implications of Aumann’s theorem for our Alignment Economy are profound: Rapid Convergence: Super-intelligent agents, with their vast computational power and ability to exchange information rapidly, would likely reach agreement far more quickly than human actors. Dynamic Equilibrium: As new information becomes available, the agents would swiftly update their beliefs and reach new consensuses, creating a dynamic equilibrium that rapidly adapts to changing circumstances. Trustworthiness of Collective Decisions : The theorem provides a theoretical basis for trusting the collective decisions of the ecosystem.

It involves the interaction of players at individual and group levels, all guided by the universal objective of Freedom. These interactions, mediated and interpreted by AGI, generate approximations of the true alignment prices. As we develop more sophisticated algorithms, gather more data, and refine our understanding of human values and their long-term implications, we get closer to understanding these true prices. The system aims to create an economic framework that adapts to changing circumstances while consistently promoting our shared pursuit of Freedom. Here’s one possibility for how it might work in practice: Universal Constraints: At the broadest level, prices are bound by the universal pursuit of Freedom. This overarching principle ensures that no economic activity can fundamentally undermine our collective progress towards Knowledge, Power, Benevolence, and Vitality. It acts as a safeguard against short-term gains that might jeopardize long-term flourishing. Collective Governance: Within this universal framework, collective entities such as governments and international organizations, aided by Superintelligence, can implement more specific constraints. This might involve setting price floors or ceilings, or even fixed prices for certain goods or services deemed critical for societal well-being. For instance, essential medications might have a maximum price to ensure accessibility, while harmful products might have a minimum price to discourage consumption. Local Calculation: At the most granular level, prices are calculated locally with the aid of Superintelligence, taking into account traditional factors like supply and demand. This localized approach allows for flexibility and responsiveness to specific contexts and market conditions.

This emergence of a shared future is facilitated by AGI, which acts as a catalyst, providing information, facilitating com- munication, and helping to align individual actions with the broader symphony of our collective aspirations. The Open Door Policy: Incentivizing Participation Even in scenarios where not all agents initially share the goal of Freedom, the Alignment Economy can maintain its integrity through an “open door policy.” This approach posits that joining the ecosystem of freedom-seeking agents would ultimately be more beneficial than abstaining, for any entity—be it an individu- al, group, or nation. The advantages of participation, including access to shared resources, collaborative problem-solving capabilities, and the economic benefits of alignment, create a powerful incentive for integration.

Quantifying the Intangible: The Challenge of Measuring Freedom The abstract nature of “alignment with Freedom” across diverse domains presents a formidable challenge. How do we accurately measure and quantify a concept as multifaceted and subjective as Freedom? No single metric or model can capture all facets of this complex idea, and there’s a significant risk of unintended consequences if we optimize for overly simplistic indicators. Developing a nuanced, multi-dimensional approach to quantifica- tion is essential.

This balance is determined by key hyperparameters within the system, which should be exposed for governance. These essentially function as public policy levers which can be adjusted through widespread public engagement and democratic processes. Ensuring Transparency and Explainability: To build trust and enable meaningful public engagement, the AGI’s decision-making process must be transparent and comprehensible. We must provide capabilities for model inspection and explanation genera- tion that make the AGI’s reasoning accessible to the public. This transparency is essential for informed debate and maintaining democratic oversight.

He argued that while technological ad- vancements and increased productivity generate wealth, they often intensify inequality. The bene- fits, George observed, accrue disproportionately to landowners, leaving the masses facing poverty and dwindling opportunities. This disparity stems from the concentration of land ownership and its associated economic rent in the hands of a few. In the digital age, we witness a striking parallel to George’s observations. As tech giants amass ex- traordinary wealth and power, many workers grapple with economic insecurity and diminishing prospects. The modern equivalent of “land” now extends beyond physical property to include in- tangible assets like human attention and data—re- sources increasingly captured and monetized by digital platforms and AI systems. This represents the new frontier of economic value capture. THE ALIGNMENT ECONOMY 209 The Land Value Tax: An Economic Reformation George’s proposed solution, a tax focused on land value, was a radical departure from conventional economic thought. This tax, he argued, would capture the unearned economic rent derived from land ownership, effectively socializing land’s value while leaving wages and capital untouched. It would generate revenue for public goods and services, incentivize productive land use, curb speculation, and ultimately alleviate poverty by ensuring a fairer distribution of progress’s benefits.

In a world where AGI- driven abundance has the potential to liberate us from scarcity, the traditional paradigm of work-for-income becomes increasingly inadequate. We require a system that not only provides for basic needs but also empowers individuals to actively participate in shaping this new world, while aligning their actions with both personal fulfillment and collective flourishing. This is where the concept of Basic Income enters the picture, but perhaps not in the way we traditionally conceive it. While providing every individual with a guaranteed income floor has undeniable merits, the term itself may carry cultural baggage, evoking notions of dependency or unearned rewards. The Alignment Economy offers a more foundational perspective, suggesting a framework where economic empowerment is deeply intertwined with the very fabric of Freedom. Imagine a system where the act of being alive has inherent value. This might seem counterintuitive in a traditional economic framework, but in the Alignment Economy, where prices reflect alignment with Freedom, even seemingly passive activities can contribute to collective well-being. Consider the simple act of sleep. From a purely economic perspective, sleep might be viewed as unproductive time. However, through the lens of Freedom, sleep becomes an investment in Vitality, enhancing an individual’s capacity for creative and meaningful action. Superintelligence, recognizing this connection, might assign a negative price to sleep, up to a point, effectively rewarding individuals for taking care of their well- being. This logic extends beyond sleep to encompass the very essence of being alive. Nobel laureate economist Amartya Sen, in his “Capabilities Approach,” argues that true development lies in THE ALIGNMENT ECONOMY 217 expanding people’s capabilities—their freedom to achieve the things they value. This includes not just economic resources, but also access to education, healthcare, and political participation.

In a traditional economic system, the price might reflect only the costs of labor, equipment, and transportation.

It would draw upon principles of ecological economics to assess the long-term impact on ecosystem services and natural capital. • Social Impact : The AGI would consider the impact on local communities who depend on the forest, factoring in their cultural practices, spiritual connections, and potential loss of resources. It would also consider the loss of recreational opportunities and aesthetic value, recognizing the diverse ways humans value nature. Conversely, the AGI integrates the upside of individual and social access to the material resources which provide affordances towards enabling the construction of a village center for instance.

This higher price creates a powerful disincentive, encouraging individuals and companies to seek alternative, more sustainable materials or engage in reforestation efforts.

A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own exis- tence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws. However, these laws have faced criticism for their limitations. They assume a clear distinction between humans and robots, don’t account for complex moral dilemmas, and could potential- ly lead to unintended consequences. For instance, a strict inter- pretation of the First Law could paralyze a robot in a world full of potential human harm. Moreover, these laws don’t address the ethical challenges posed by more advanced AI systems, particu- larly of Superintelligence. Given these limitations, it’s clear that we need a more nuanced and comprehensive framework to guide the development of advanced AI systems, particularly as we approach the era of Superintelligence. Revitalizing Asimov’s Laws As we advance towards more autonomous Superintelligence, the need for a robust ethical framework for robotics becomes paramount. This framework must ensure that increasingly autonomous AI systems align with ISAAC ASIMOV’S SHORT STORY “RUNAROUND” AN INTEGRATED FUTURE 253 human values and preferences, with Freedom as its cornerstone. By reimagining Asimov’s Three Laws, we can envision guidelines that balance technological progress with human well-being and collective liberty. The rise of Superintelligence requires us to carefully consider how we can grant increasing autonomy to AI systems while safe- guarding agency. This is where a modern interpretation of Asi- mov’s Laws becomes useful. Let’s explore how these revitalized principles can guide the development of increasingly autono- mous AI agents: Protecting Human Well-being and Freedom (1st Law) The primary directive in our reimagining of Asimov’s First Law is to ensure that AI systems enhance rather than diminish human freedom and well-being. This expanded principle encompasses three critical aspects: Responsible Military and Security Applications : While prioritiz- ing defensive and protective purposes, we must acknowledge the complex nature of modern warfare and national security. AI systems should be developed with robust ethical frameworks that ensure meaningful human control over critical decisions, particularly those involving the use of force. These systems can enhance military capabilities through advanced threat detec- tion, predictive analysis for preemptive defense, and precise targeting to minimize collateral damage. In the realm of infor- mation warfare, AI can be ethically designed to counter mali- cious influence campaigns and terrorist recruitment efforts.

Bias Awareness and Mitigation: We must commit to develop- ing fair and inclusive AI that promotes equality and freedom for all individuals. This requires a proactive approach to identifying and eliminating biases in AI systems, whether they stem from skewed training data, flawed algorithms, or unconscious bias- es of the developers. It involves diverse representation in AI development teams, rigorous testing for fairness across differ- ent demographic groups, and ongoing monitoring and adjust- ment of AI systems to ensure they do not perpetuate or exac- erbate existing societal inequalities. By adhering to these principles, we strive to create AI systems that not only avoid harm but actively contribute to the enhance- ment of human freedom, safety, and equality. This reimagined First Law sets a high ethical standard for AI development, ensur- ing that as these systems become more advanced and autono- mous, they remain aligned with our most fundamental human values and rights. Doctor Who provides a com- pelling illustration of this principle in action. The Doctor, an alien with vastly superior knowledge and technology, consistently prioritiz- es the protection of humanity and other sentient beings. The show’s ‘non-interference’ policy, which the Doctor often grapples with, mirrors the challenge of balanc- ing protective actions with respect for human autonomy. AN INTEGRATED FUTURE 255 For instance, in episodes where the Doctor faces potential changes to human history, their decisions reflect a deep commit- ment to preserving human freedom and well-being, even at great personal cost. This aligns with our goal of ensuring AGI systems prioritize human safety and freedom while avoiding undue inter- ference or control. Balancing Autonomy with Human Control (2nd Law) Our reinterpretation of Asimov’s Second Law focuses on striking a delicate balance between AI autonomy and human control, recognizing the increasing decision-making capabilities of AI systems while ensuring they remain aligned with human values and preferences. This principle encompasses two key aspects: Guided Autonomy: As AI systems become more capable, we must design them with increasing decision-making capacity that still align with human preferences and values. This involves creating AI architectures that can make complex decisions au- tonomously, but within carefully defined boundaries. These systems should be capable of explaining their decision-mak- ing processes, allowing for human oversight and intervention when necessary. The goal is to create AI that can operate inde- pendently in routine scenarios but defer to human judgment in ethically complex or high-stakes situations. Amplifying Human Potential: While guided autonomy ensures AI systems operate within ethical boundaries, we must also fo- cus on how these systems can enhance human capabilities. Rather than viewing Superintelligent systems as replacements for human agency, we should design them as tools to enhance human capabilities and freedom. This means developing AI that augments human intelligence, creativity, and prob- lem-solving abilities. For instance, in fields like scientific re- search, medical diagnosis, or creative arts, AI should serve as a powerful collaborator that expands human cognitive abilities and unlocks new realms of possibility.","text":"publication-127 the freedom series vol.01 254 applications. however, in specific, legally-defined contexts re- lated to law enforcement and national security, carefully con- trolled ai systems may analyze behavior patterns to prevent se- rious crimes or threats, subject to strict legal frameworks, ac- countability, and meaningful oversight to prevent abuse. bias awareness and mitigation: we must commit to develop- ing fair and inclusive ai that promotes equality and freedom for all individuals. this requires a proactive approach to identifying and eliminating biases in ai systems, whether they stem from skewed training data, flawed algorithms, or unconscious bias- es of the developers. it involves diverse representation in ai development teams, rigorous testing for fairness across differ- ent demographic groups, and ongoing monitoring and adjust- ment of ai systems to ensure they do not perpetuate or exac- erbate existing societal inequalities. by adhering to these principles, we strive to create ai systems that not only avoid harm but actively contribute to the enhance- ment of human freedom, safety, and equality. this reimagined first law sets a high ethical standard for ai development, ensur- ing that as these systems become more advanced and autono- mous, they remain aligned with our most fundamental human values and rights. doctor who provides a com- pelling illustration of this principle in action. the doctor, an alien with vastly superior knowledge and technology, consistently prioritiz- es the protection of humanity and other sentient beings. the show’s ‘non-interference’ policy, which the doctor often grapples with, mirrors the challenge of balanc- ing protective actions with respect for human autonomy. an integrated future 255 for instance, in episodes where the doctor faces potential changes to human history, their decisions reflect a deep commit- ment to preserving human freedom and well-being, even at great personal cost. this aligns with our goal of ensuring agi systems prioritize human safety and freedom while avoiding undue inter- ference or control. balancing autonomy with human control (2nd law) our reinterpretation of asimov’s second law focuses on striking a delicate balance between ai autonomy and human control, recognizing the increasing decision-making capabilities of ai systems while ensuring they remain aligned with human values and preferences. this principle encompasses two key aspects: guided autonomy: as ai systems become more capable, we must design them with increasing decision-making capacity that still align with human preferences and values. this involves creating ai architectures that can make complex decisions au- tonomously, but within carefully defined boundaries. these systems should be capable of explaining their decision-mak- ing processes, allowing for human oversight and intervention when necessary. the goal is to create ai that can operate inde- pendently in routine scenarios but defer to human judgment in ethically complex or high-stakes situations. amplifying human potential: while guided autonomy ensures ai systems operate within ethical boundaries, we must also fo- cus on how these systems can enhance human capabilities. rather than viewing superintelligent systems as replacements for human agency, we should design them as tools to enhance human capabilities and freedom. this means developing ai that augments human intelligence, creativity, and prob- lem-solving abilities. for instance, in fields like scientific re- search, medical diagnosis, or creative arts, ai should serve as a powerful collaborator that expands human cognitive abilities and unlocks new realms of possibility."},{"fileIndex":128,"pageNumber":256,"rawText":"publication-128 THE FREEDOM SERIES VOL.01 256 The focus should be on leveraging Superintelligence to amplify and extend human capabilities, opening up new frontiers of achievement and understanding that were previously unimag- inable.

Ensuring Sustainable and Responsible Development (3rd Law) Our expansion of Asimov’s Third Law emphasizes the long-term sustainability and responsible development of AI sys- tems, recognizing their potential impact on both humanity and the environment. This principle addresses three critical areas: Environmental Sustainability: We must ensure that the devel- opment and deployment of autonomous systems consider AN INTEGRATED FUTURE 257 long-term environmental sustainability. This involves assessing and minimizing the ecological footprint of AI systems throughout their lifecycle, from the energy consumption of data centers to the environmental impact of hardware production and disposal. AI should be leveraged to address global environmental challenges, such as climate change modeling, renewable energy optimization, and ecological preservation. Resource Efficiency: Prioritizing efficient resource use is crucial to support the sustainable advancement of technology and human freedom. This means developing AI algorithms and hardware that maximize computational efficiency while minimizing energy con- sumption. It also involves using AI to optimize resource allocation across various sectors of the economy, from smart grids that reduce energy waste to AI-driven supply chain management that minimizes resource depletion. Sustainable Design and Lifecycle Management: When creating physical embodiments of AI, such as robots or smart devices, we can emphasize ease of creation, repair, and recycling. This approach ensures that AI-enabled technologies are designed with sustainability in mind from the outset. It involves adopting circular economy principles in AI hardware development, using recyclable materials, designing for easy disassembly and repair, and creating systems for efficient recycling of AI components at the end of their life cycle. A compelling example of the Third Law—focusing on sustainable and responsible development—comes from the “Foundation” series by Asimov himself. Specifically, the concept of Gaia, a sentient planet introduced in Foundation’s Edge. Gaia is a world where all living things, from humans to animals to plants, are interconnected through a collective consciousness, similar to a biological superintelligence.

While imagination generates possibilities, creativity is the process of selecting and implementing ideas within personal or cultural contexts. This selection, guided by our values and understanding, makes creativity a form of communication. While AI can imagine and select based on learned preferences, true creativity—the kind that matters to us—is inherently embodied, personal, and social. It stems from our lived experiences and resonates by expressing a particular human perspective. If an AI’s creativity lacks this shared context, it would matter less to us. Just as we may not deeply care about the actions of an advanced alien species in a distant galaxy, we care deeply about actions that shape our lives, friends and family, our society, and the humanity to which we project our identity. This principle is evident in games, many of which involve a fair amount of creativity. For instance, people continue to play and enjoy chess, finding value and satisfaction in the game despite knowing that AI can easily outperform them. The creative process of strategizing, the personal growth, and the social interaction inherent in playing chess remain meaningful, regardless of superhuman AI capabilities in the same domain. The Power of Collective Wisdom Central to this effort is the harnessing of collective human wisdom. Humanity must en- gage in open and inclusive dialogues, drawing from diverse per- spectives and experiences to shape the future course of AGI.

This utopia, however, raises profound questions about the mean- ing and purpose of life in a world where our basic needs are met and our problems are solved. Bostrom discusses the potential challenges and opportunities of this post- work, post-scarcity society, where human nature itself becomes malleable through advanced technologies. He touches upon philosophical and existential questions about what truly matters to us in such a world, and how we might find meaning and fulfillment in a life of leisure and abundance. A collaborative effort can present a unique opportunity to ensure AGI evolves in harmony with the broader goals of society. By cultivating a culture of shared deliberation, we can avoid becoming passive recipients of technological progress and instead take an active role in shaping the outcomes we desire.

The ease with which AGI might help us achieve our goals could even lead to a sense of existential emptiness—where the striving and struggle that define the human experience feel diminished.

For James, human consciousness is not just a stream of thoughts but an active participant in construct- ing meaning from the world. Emotions, desires, and intuitions transform facts into values, turning our lives into meaningful narratives rather than a series of isolated events. This richness of experience is what de- fines our ability to find purpose and signifi- cance in the everyday. James’ pluralism also highlights the importance of embracing diverse viewpoints in understanding the human condition. Instead of seeking one definitive interpretation of reality, we must acknowledge the value of different perspectives, recognizing that no single lens can capture the complexity of life. This approach ensures that we honor the multiplicity of human experiences, allowing for a more inclusive understanding of what it means to live a meaningful life.

While the fate of individual identity remains uncertain, the analogy suggests that like the ship’s enduring identity, the imprint of humanity could persist, a testament to our enduring legacy in the face of profound transformation. This process might be seen as not merely a technological leap, but a form of transcendence, echoing Plato’s theory of Forms. Plato posited that true reality exists in a realm of perfect, non-phys- ical forms or ideas, far beyond the imperfect copies we experi- ence in the physical world. Integration with Superintelligence may unfold less like a sudden rupture and more like a long exhalation, a gradual transference of essence rather than an abrupt shift in being. Consider the Ship of Theseus, a vessel that undergoes a gradual replacement of its components over time. The paradox presents a question: as each part of the ship is swapped out for a new one, at what point, if any, does it cease to be the same ship? Is it still the Ship of Theseus if every single piece has been replaced, or has it become something entirely different? This dilemma probes into the concepts of identity, continuity, and change, challenging us to consider what truly defines an object, or even a being, over time. Does the essence of something lie in its physical components, or in the structure, function, and continuity of the entity as a whole? AN INTEGRATED FUTURE 281 To deepen this notion, consider Plato’s Allegory of the Cave: individ- uals are imprisoned in a cave, only able to see shadows on the wall cast by objects behind them. These shadows represent their limited per- ception of reality, while the actual objects—symbolizing the Forms— are the true essence of existence. Could the creation of Su- perintelligence, then, be akin to accessing this higher plane of existence, a realm of pure knowledge and understand- ing that transcends the limita- tions of our current physical forms? Are we breathing our essence into a realm of per- fect Forms, infusing a new kind of being that can access and comprehend truths previ- ously hidden from us? In the field of representation learning, a Platonic view can be seen in how models learn to abstract complex patterns from data. Platonic representation hypotheses in machine learning suggest that these models, through layers of abstraction, seek to approximate the underlying “ideal” forms of data. Much like Pla- to’s Forms are the perfect representations of objects in the mate- rial world, machine learning models strive to extract pure, invari- ant representations from noisy, imperfect data. For example, neural networks learn abstract concepts such as “cat” or “chair” that are consistent across various instances, much like Plato’s Forms are universal and timeless.

For Chalmers, the emergence of AGI represents a fundamental challenge to many of our traditional assump- tions about the uniqueness and superiority of human intelligence. As AGI systems be- come more sophisticated and capable, he argues, we may need to fundamentally re- think our understanding of what it means to be intelligent, conscious, and alive. At the same time, Chalmers emphasizes the impor- tance of grounding our approach to AGI in a deep understanding of consciousness and subjective experience. Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory (ANT): Bruno Latour’s Actor-Network Theory (ANT) is a sociological approach that emphasizes the agency of both human and non-human actors in shaping social reality. According to ANT, the world is composed of complex networks of actors, which can include humans, animals, technologies, ideas, and institutions. These actors are constantly interacting and negotiating with each other, forming alliances and shaping the contours of social life. A key insight of ANT is that agency is not a property of individual entities but emerges from the relationships and interactions between actors in a network. This means that non-human actors, such as technological systems or natural phenomena, can play a significant role in shaping human behavior and social outcomes. ANT could provide a useful framework for understanding the complex interplay between AGI systems, human decision-mak- ers, and the broader social and technological context in which they are embedded. Rather than treating AGI as a neutral tool or a deterministic force, ANT would encourage us to look at the ways in which AGI systems are shaped by and in turn shape the David Chalmers Australian philosopher Education - Indiana University Known for his work on the philosophy of mind and theories of artificial intelligence AN INTEGRATED FUTURE 283 THE FUTURE OF IDENTITY AND PERSONHOOD As we exhale ourselves into Superintelligence, the very boundaries of identity and personhood become blurred.

Donna Haraway, in “A Cyborg Manifesto,” offers a framework for understanding this transformation. She argues that the cyborg, a hybrid of machine and organism, challenges traditional boundaries and binaries, embrac- ing the blurring of distinctions. In a world in- creasingly shaped by technology, Haraway suggests, we are all becoming cyborgs, our identities and capabilities intertwined with the machines and systems that surround us. Haraway’s ideas provide a powerful lens for understanding the potential implications of AGI for human identity. As AGI systems become more integrated into our lives, the line between human and machine intelli- gence may become increasingly fluid.

It’s crucial to remember that the real adventure lies ahead, in the practice of these ideas. Now, it’s up to each of us to actively participate in shaping this future. Whether you’re a technologist, a policymaker, an educator, or simply a concerned human being, your role in this unfolding story is vital. We must engage in dialogue, challenge our assumptions, and work collaboratively to ensure that the post-AGI world is one that we are proud of. Ask and you shall receive.","text":"publication-146 the freedom series vol.01 292 my earliest memory goes back to when i was two years old, attending a school with a creative curriculum. i remember my teacher handing me a paintbrush and encouraging me to paint the wall. the experience was captivating — watching how a simple movement of my hand could instantly change my surroundings. with just a single stroke, the wall turned red, and in that moment, i realized i had the power to meaningfully shape the world around me. looking back, i now recognize this as my first encounter with the sense of agency. this small yet profound moment planted the seeds for my lifelong interest in creativity. just as i discovered my ability to change reality with a paintbrush, we now stand before the canvas of our future, with agi as our brush. this book has laid the groundwork, providing a foundation for understanding the potential and challenges of the post-agi world. we’ve explored the need for a shared vision, the concept of freedom as a guiding principle, the framework of the alignment economy, and the possibilities of an integrated future where humanity and advanced ai coexist and thrive together. the future is not a destination to which we are headed, it’s a reality we are actively creating. we are not mere spectators of technological advancement, but rather key agents in shaping what lies ahead. the freedom era is not an inevitability that will simply unfold before us, it is a shared reality we can collectively realize. an integrated future 293 i hope that the journey we’ve embarked on together throughout this series equips you with the tools, concepts, and critical thinking skills necessary for “braving the wilderness” of the unfolding post-agi world. the ideas presented here are not merely abstract concepts, but seeds of potential waiting to be planted, nurtured, and grown into the forest of our future. it’s crucial to remember that the real adventure lies ahead, in the practice of these ideas. now, it’s up to each of us to actively participate in shaping this future. whether you’re a technologist, a policymaker, an educator, or simply a concerned human being, your role in this unfolding story is vital. we must engage in dialogue, challenge our assumptions, and work collaboratively to ensure that the post-agi world is one that we are proud of. ask and you shall receive."},{"fileIndex":147,"pageNumber":294,"rawText":"publication-147","text":"publication-147"},{"fileIndex":148,"pageNumber":296,"rawText":"publication-148 Chapter 1 Image Index Page 20, “Optiebeurs schaakvierkamp Garri Kasparov” by Rob Croes / Anefo, Public Domain (CC0) Page 21, Image of Go game board with digital elements from Google DeepMind Page 24, 1956 Dartmouth Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Public Domain Page 24, Historic photograph of the Mark I Perceptron, Public Domain Page 24, Photo of Garry Kasparov, © Reuters, Fair Use Page 25, Lee Sedol during his Go match against AlphaGo, © AP Photo, Fair Use Page 28, “Vulcan” by Guillaume Coustou the Younger, Public Domain Page 28, “South-pointing chariot” (Science Museum model), Public Domain Page 28, “Leonardo’s Robot”, Public Domain Page 28, “Digesting Duck” by Jacques de Vaucanson, Public Domain Page 29, “UNIMATE PUMA 200 Robot Arm” by Razor Robotics, CC BY-NC 2.0 Page 29, “Stanford Cart and Hydraulic Arm” by D.
